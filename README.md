- publishes OrderEvent (order.created) to RabbitMQ
- persists Order to DB

## Installation
1. Pre-requisites
   Install RabbitMQ, Java17, PostgreSQL DB. Start the RabbitMQ server and test the DB connection.
2. Clone the repository from GitHub.
    ```shell
    git clone  https://github.com/Dzsodie/OrderService.git
    ```
## Starting the application

## API documentation
Swagger documentation is available at: http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html after the application started successfully.
## Logging and monitoring
SLF4J is used for logging.
Log aggregation is not yet implemented, but Datadog offers an easy to implement solution with user-friendly monitoring interface.
## Testing
1. Mockito and JUnit5 is used for the unit testing.
2. Test coverage needs to be improved. Coverage report can be reached with this command.
    ```shell
    mvn jacoco:report
    ```
